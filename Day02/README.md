## Why Do We Need Kubernetes?

Let's see what are the problems with Docker:

1. **Single Host concept** â€“ The nature of Docker or container platforms is scoped to one single host. Because it is only one host, the containers impact each other. If one of the containers is affected, there is no way to make this container come up automatically without manual intervention.

2. **Self Healing** â€“ Let's say one of the containers is killed for some reason, the associated app will be inaccessible. Auto healing is a behavior where, without the userâ€™s manual intervention, the container starts by itself. But this doesnâ€™t happen in Docker. The problem is that a DevOps engineer canâ€™t continuously monitor thousands of containers.

3. **Auto Scaling** â€“ Suppose you have one container. During festival season the user count will increase, and automatically the container goes into high load. At that time, we should either manually or automatically scale it up. But Docker does not support both options since a load balancer is required when we scale containers. Auto scaling means as soon as one container is overloaded, it should scale up automatically (e.g., from 1 to 10 containers).

4. **Docker is simple** â€“ Docker does not support enterprise-level requirements, and it is never used in production.

## How Kubernetes Solves These Problems

Kubernetes (K8s) is a container orchestration platform, while Docker is just a container runtime. Kubernetes is generally installed as a cluster, which is a group of nodes (master/control plane + worker nodes).

It helps manage and organize containers automatically. Kubernetes makes sure your containers keep running, can scale up when thereâ€™s more traffic, and can move to healthy machines if something goes wrong.


**Kubernetes provides:**

1. **Enterprise-Level Support** â€“ Kubernetes is designed to run applications in production. That means it can handle large-scale, business-critical apps. It gives support for high security, scaling, monitoring, and upgrades â€” things that are must-have in enterprises (not just small projects).

2. **Self-Healing** â€“ If a container fails or a node crashes, Kubernetes will automatically restart or move the container to a healthy node. This avoids manual fixing. So apps stay up and running without you needing to always watch them.

3. **Auto-Scaling** â€“ When traffic increases (like festival sales), Kubernetes can add more containers automatically. When traffic decreases, it can remove extra containers to save resources. This way, apps can handle sudden spikes and drops without downtime.

4. **High Availability & Load Balancing** â€“ Instead of putting all load on a single node or container, Kubernetes spreads the traffic across multiple containers and nodes. This makes sure if one fails, others still handle the requests. End users wonâ€™t feel the failure.

5. **Rolling Updates & Rollbacks** â€“ If you deploy a new version of your app, Kubernetes updates it step by step (rolling update) so thereâ€™s no downtime. And if something breaks, you can roll back to the previous version quickly.

_ðŸ‘‰ This way, Kubernetes makes your apps production-ready, reliable, and always running smoothly._



## Why called as K8s?

The word Kubernetes has 10 letters. There are 8 letters between K and s, so people started calling it K8s for simplicity.

## In technical Terms


## Why Do We Need Kubernetes?
Letâ€™s first look at some of the limitations of Docker (when used alone without orchestration):

**Single Host Limitation** â€“ By nature, Docker containers run on a single host. If multiple containers are running on the same host, one containerâ€™s issue (e.g., resource hogging, crash) can affect others. Also, if the host itself goes down, thereâ€™s no built-in mechanism for the containers to come back automatically.

**Lack of Self-Healing** â€“ If a container crashes in Docker, the application becomes inaccessible. Docker itself does not provide an automatic restart or self-healing mechanism at scale. As a DevOps engineer, itâ€™s practically impossible to manually monitor and restart thousands of containers running in production.

**No Native Auto-Scaling** â€“ Imagine youâ€™re running a shopping app with one container. During a festive season, user traffic suddenly spikes. Ideally, new containers should automatically spin up to handle the load (horizontal scaling). Docker does not provide this feature natively. It also lacks built-in load balancing to distribute requests across multiple containers.

**Not Production-Ready Alone** â€“ Docker is excellent for building and running containers, but by itself it lacks the enterprise-grade features (scaling, high availability, rolling updates, monitoring, etc.) required for production workloads.

## What is Kubernetes?

Kubernetes is an open-source platform that helps you automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. In simple words, if you're running a lot of apps using containers (like with Docker), Kubernetes helps you organize and control them efficiently just like a traffic controller for your apps.
